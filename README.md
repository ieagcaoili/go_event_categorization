# Event Categorization

Here is a quick look at Eventbrite events, and an approach to categorize a small sample of these events. It also includes a quick look at the Ticket Master events for comparison. The goal is to be familiar with both datasets, and leverage as much of the existing data as possible in figuring out ways to categorize.

The files included are as follows:
- Event_Categorization.ipynb - the notebook with the script for categorizing
- eb-response-page1.json - JSON file from Eventbrite
- tm-response-page1.json - JSON file from Ticket Master
